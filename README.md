# CatDogDetector 🐱🐶
Welcome to CatDogDetector, a fun and powerful machine learning project that classifies images as either a cat or a dog with high accuracy! Built using Python and deep learning, this project is perfect for pet enthusiasts, machine learning beginners, and anyone curious about computer vision.

  
  
  



  


🌟 Features

Accurate Classification: Uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish between cats and dogs.
Easy to Use: Simple scripts to train the model or predict on new images.
Customizable: Modify the model architecture or dataset to suit your needs.
Beginner-Friendly: Well-documented code with step-by-step instructions.
Fast Inference: Optimized for quick predictions on new images.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the CatDogDetector up and running on your machine!
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
pip (Python package manager)
A love for cats and dogs! 😺🐶

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/visxnu/CatDogDetector.git
cd CatDogDetector


Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Download the Dataset:

The project uses the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset. Download it and place it in the data/ folder.
Alternatively, use your own dataset of cat and dog images.



Usage

Train the Model:
python train.py

This will train the CNN model and save it to the models/ directory.

Predict on a New Image:
python predict.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg

The script will output whether the image is a cat or a dog!

Explore the Jupyter Notebook:Check out notebook/CatDogDetector.ipynb for an interactive walkthrough of the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
