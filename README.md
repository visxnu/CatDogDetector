## 🌟 Features

- **Accurate Classification**: Uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish between cats and dogs.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple scripts to train the model or predict on new images.
- **Customizable**: Modify the model architecture or dataset to suit your needs.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Well-documented code with step-by-step instructions.
- **Fast Inference**: Optimized for quick predictions on new images.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the CatDogDetector up and running on your machine!

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- A love for cats and dogs! 😺🐶

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/visxnu/CatDogDetector.git
   cd CatDogDetector
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Dataset**:
   - The project uses the [Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). Download it and place it in the `data/` folder.
   - Alternatively, use your own dataset of cat and dog images.

### Usage

1. **Train the Model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
   This will train the CNN model and save it to the `models/` directory.

2. **Predict on a New Image**:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```
   The script will output whether the image is a cat or a dog!

3. **Explore the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Check out `notebook/CatDogDetector.ipynb` for an interactive walkthrough of the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
